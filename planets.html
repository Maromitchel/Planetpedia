        <p>At the center of our Solar System lies the Sun — a massive,
            glowing sphere of hot plasma. It holds 99.8% of the Solar System’s 
            total mass and powers every planet, moon, and life form with its intense energy. 
            Deep within its core, nuclear fusion generates the light and heat that 
            make life on Earth possible.</p>

        <p>Closest to the Sun is Mercury, a small, rocky planet with no atmosphere
             to shield it from solar radiation. As a result, temperatures swing dramatically — scorching 
             hot by day and freezing at night. Its surface is heavily cratered, resembling the Moon, 
             and a year on Mercury lasts just 88 Earth days.</p>

        <p>Venus is Earth's twin in size but not in nature.
            Thick clouds of carbon dioxide trap heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, 
            making it the hottest planet in the Solar System. Surface temperatures soar above 460°C, 
            and its slow, retrograde rotation means a day is longer than its year. The atmosphere is toxic, yet 
            its golden glow in the sky remains beautiful.

            70% of its surface and a protective atmosphere rich in oxygen and nitrogen, Earth has the perfect 
            conditions for life to thrive. It has one natural satellite, the Moon, which influences tides and 
            stabilizes Earth's rotation.

             Mars hosts the tallest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons, and continues to be the focus of 
             exploration for future human missions.

            centuries. Jupiter has more than 95 moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the Solar System, 
            which is even bigger than Mercury.

        <p>Famous for its breathtaking rings, Saturn is a gas giant with a low density — it could float in water. 
            Its rings are made of ice and rock, forming dazzling patterns that stretch across hundreds of thousands of 
            kilometers. Saturn is surrounded by over 140 moons, including Titan, which has rivers and lakes of liquid 
            methane.

        <p>Uranus is an ice giant with a bluish hue due to methane in its atmosphere. 
            What sets it apart is its extreme tilt — it rotates almost on its side, giving it unique seasons 
            that last for decades. Though cold and distant, Uranus adds to the mystery and diversity
             of the outer planets.

            Though it's an ice giant like Uranus, Neptune is more dynamic, with visible storms 
            and a faint ring system.

        <h1>Pluto and the Dwarf Planets</h1>
       
        <div class="description">
             
        <p>Pluto, once the ninth planet, is now classified as a dwarf planet after a 2006 redefinition by 
            the International Astronomical Union. Though small—about two-thirds the size of Earth’s moon—Pluto
            is geologically active, featuring icy mountains, vast plains, and a heart-shaped glacier called Tombaugh 
            Regio. It has a thin atmosphere of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide, which expands and freezes 
            depending on its distance from the Sun. Pluto’s largest moon, Charon, forms a unique double system with it, 
            alongside four smaller moons: Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Beyond Pluto lie other dwarf planets in the 
            Kuiper Belt, including Eris, which is more massive than Pluto and helped prompt its reclassification. Haumea 
            spins so rapidly it is shaped like an egg and is the first known dwarf planet with rings. Makemake is a 
            bright, icy world with a faint moon, and Ceres—the only dwarf planet in the asteroid belt—may host briny 
            underground oceans. These small bodies are ancient remnants of the early Solar System and hold clues to 
            its formation. As space technology advances, dwarf planets continue to reshape our understanding of the 
            cosmos.
