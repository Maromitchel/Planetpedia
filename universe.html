                came from and where we’re going.”</p>

            <h2>Exoplanets</h2>
            <p>Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars outside our solar system. Some are huge 
                like Jupiter, and others are small and rocky like Earth. Scientists have found thousands 
                of them, and some even lie in the “habitable zone,” where it might be just the right 
                temperature for liquid water — and maybe even life.</p>

            <h2>Stars</h2>
            <p>Stars are massive balls of hot gas that shine by burning hydrogen in their cores. 
                They come in different sizes and colors, from small red ones to giant blue ones. 
                Our Sun is a star too — an average one. Stars live for millions or even billions of years 
                before they die and turn into white dwarfs, neutron stars, or even black holes, depending 
                on how big they were.</p>

            <h2>Nebulae</h2>
            <p>Nebulae are huge clouds of gas and dust floating in space. Some are created when stars die, 
                while others are places where new stars are born. They often glow with beautiful colors when 
                lit by nearby stars. One of the most famous nebulae is the Orion Nebula, which is actually a 
                stellar nursery making new stars right now.</p>

        <div class="universe-info">
            <h2>Black Holes</h2>
            <p>Black Holes are extremely dense points in space where gravity is so strong that not even 
                light can escape. They usually form when very massive stars collapse after using up 
                all their fuel. Although they can’t be seen directly, we know they’re there because of 
                how they affect nearby stars and light. Most galaxies, including ours, have a giant black 
                hole at the center.</p>
